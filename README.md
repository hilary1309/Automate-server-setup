- **Firewall Configuration**: Automatically configures firewall rules to allow necessary traffic.
- **SSH Security**: Implements recommended practices for securing SSH access.

## Requirements

- A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
- A MacOS-based operating system
- Root or sudo privileges on the server

    chmod +x server_setup_macos.py or chmod +x server_setup_linux.py
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    sudo ./chmod +x server_setup_macos.py or sudo ./chmod +x server_setup_linux.py
    ```
